I love to read and write, I love to learn languages, I love to go running and weight lift, I love taking care of my plants, I love cooking from scratch to save money,
While at turing I hope to be able to maintain some semblance of these hobbies even if not to the same level as before or after.
My favorite hobby today is taking care of my house plants.
I also love to travel near and far. I always have a trip planned.
